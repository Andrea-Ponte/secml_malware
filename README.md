# SecML Malware plugin

This is a plugin for the [SecML](https://secml.gitlab.io) Python library.
There is a [pre-trained MalConv](https://github.com/endgameinc/ember) model trained by EndGame, included in this project for testing.

# Included Attacks

* **Partial DOS Header manipulation**, formulated by [Demetrio et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03583)
* **Padding attack**, formulated by [Kolosnjaji et al.](http://pralab.diee.unica.it/sites/default/files/kolosnjaji18-eusipco.pdf)
* **GAMMA**, formulated by [Demetrio et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13526)
* **FGSM padding + slack** formulated by [Kreuk et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04528) and [Suciu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08280)
* **Content shifting and DOS header extension** formulated by [Demetrio et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07125.pdf)


# Installation

Navigate to the folder where you want to clone the project.
I recommend creating a new environment (I use `conda`):
```bash
conda create -n secml-malware-env python=3.7
conda activate secml-malware-env
git clone https://github.com/zangobot/secml_malware.git
cd secml_malware
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/endgameinc/ember.git
```
You also need to install `pytorch`, [find instructions here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). 
After having installed `pytorch`, install this package locally:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
(I will upload the project on PyPi soon)

## Update on Installation

If you encouter problem due to *libmagic*, [follow this instruction](https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic#installation)

# Testing
I provide a small test suite for the attacks I have developed inside the plugin.
If you want to run them, **ADD GOODWARE/MALWARE samples!**
There are two distinct folders: 
```
secml_malware/data/goodware_samples
secml_malware/data/malware_samples/test_folder
```
Please, add samples to both folders (**if and only if** you want to run the internal tests).

# How to use
Activate your environment import the `secml_malware` package inside your script:
```python
import secml_malware
print(secml_malware.__version__)
```
The tests included in this project show how the library can be used for applying the manipulation to the input programs.
